              <br>
              Iâ€™m a 16-year-old Algerian student with a deep passion for technology, robotics, and leadership. My journey in innovation and leadership began early, and it's been fueled by my involvement in various programs, competitions, and personal projects. I was born in Moscow, and growing up between different cultures has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and collaboration. <br>
<br>
              One of my proudest accomplishments has been co-founding the first scientific club at my high school. Through this initiative, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to lead and mentor my peers in the fields of robotics and engineering. Weâ€™ve participated in numerous robotic competitions across Algeria, where Iâ€™ve honed my skills in coding, engineering, and team management. As the leader of my robotics team, I guided us to compete in the FLL (First Lego League) robotics competition, which was a valuable experience organized by the Ministry of Education in Qatar. <br>
              <br>
              Iâ€™m also passionate about using technology for good. Iâ€™m currently developing a website that helps connect disabled individuals with groups and associations that provide them with support. The goal of the site is to give visibility to these organizations and offer an AI chatbot for easy navigation and assistance. Additionally, Iâ€™ve invented a pair of glasses designed to aid blind people by alerting them to obstacles at head level, and Iâ€™m working on incorporating an AI camera to describe the environment for users. <br>
              <br>
              Iâ€™ve also been an active participant in several prestigious programs, such as the Youth Leadership Program with Algeria, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. These experiences have strengthened my leadership and communication skills. As a youth ambassador in the HundrED program, Iâ€™ve focused on educational leadership, collaborating with like-minded youth from around the world to tackle issues in education. <br>
              <br>
              Aside from academics and technology, I love playing basketball, horse riding, and organizing monthly chess workshops for children aged 9 to 14. Through chess, Iâ€™m helping kids develop critical thinking and strategic planning skills, which are not only applicable in the game but also in life. <br>
              <br>
              Looking ahead, I aim to further my studies in Colleges like Yale , where I can blend my love for technology, innovation, and leadership to create impactful solutions for global challenges. <br>
